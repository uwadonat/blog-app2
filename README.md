# Blog_app



## About The Project

This project is about a Blog, which is a regularly updated web page, through which users can add, update, delete an article. Also, users can leave comments on any articles after reading. In this project, I updated the older version of the blog I built before, now here I inserted also basic authentication so that users can not delete articles or comments without permission.
